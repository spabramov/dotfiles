-- You can add your own plugins here or in other files in this directory!
--  I promise not to create any merge conflicts in this directory :)
--
-- See the kickstart.nvim README for more information

-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
-- with the first argument being the link and the following
-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
--
-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
--
--  This is equivalent to:
--    require('Comment').setup({})

-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
--
-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do


-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
--
-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
--
-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin
